= (global) Single & Multi mapping

NOTE: this is experimental

== single & multi wrapper

[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M13+

When using WebFlux we like to wrap certain parameters & results types in reactive types like
`Mono<>` or `Flux<>`.

To achieve this the processor knows two special mappings:

* `single`: to wrap non-array like types (i.e. not a collection)
* `multi`: to wrap array like types (i.e. a collection)


=== multi

[source,yaml]
----
map:
  multi: reactor.core.publisher.Flux
----

Which will use `Flux<>` as collection wrapper instead of the original java collection type for all
list *responses* (or *parameters*). `multi` does not affect collections in model types.

=== single

To map non-array like responses to a `Mono<>` set the `single` mapping:

[source,yaml]
----
map:
 single: reactor.core.publisher.Mono
----

The processor will now wrap all non-array like response types with the given `single` mapping.


== single & multi with result mapping

It is possible to use `single` & `multi` mappings together with the `result` mapping, i.e.
`ResponseEntity`.

`result` will wrap `single`

[source, java]
----
ResponseEntity<Mono<String>>
----

and `multi`

[source, java]
----
ResponseEntity<Flux<String>>
----
