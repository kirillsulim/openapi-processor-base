= Endpoint interface grouping

The processor groups endpoints based on their _first_ tag. Using the `/ping` example again its first
(and only) tag is **ping**:

The interface name used for this api will be `PingApi`. `Ping` because `ping` is the tags name and
`Api` is a fixed string added to `Ping`.

In case no tags are available, all endpoints will be added to an `Api` interface.

The package name gets created from the configurable `packageName` parameter of the processor, and a
sub package named `api`.

If the `packageName` is configured as `com.github.hauner.openapi` the final package name for the
interface is `com.github.hauner.openapi.api`, and the full class & package name is
`com.github.hauner.openapi.api.PingApi`.
