*openapi-processor-spring* is an link:{openapi}[OpenAPI] interface & model only java code generator
for link:{springboot}[Spring Boot].

It supports an API first approach where you API is explicitly defined and documented with OpenAPI
 before it gets implemented.

The processor generates java interfaces based on the endpoint description of the API and simple POJO
classes for parameter or response objects defined in the API. The processor adds all the required
spring & jackson annotations to the interface and all that is left to *you* is the implementation
of the generated interfaces in any way you like.

The interfaces will help to keep the implementation in sync with the API. If anything relevant
changes  in the API the interface changes and the compiler will warn that the interface is not
implemented correctly.

The target programming language is Java so the generated code is usable from most JVM languages.

See the xref:processor/index.adoc[processor intro] for a short example.


== Features

- generates only java interfaces and java model classes (get/set POJOs) for all defined endpoints
and schemas to allow full control of the endpoint implementation. It does not generate any other
file. See xref:processor/index.adoc[processor].

- powerful type mappings with generic support (one level) to map schemas defined in the openapi.yaml
to existing java types.
+
For example to map the openapi `array` type to a different java collections or to map paging
parameters and results to th Spring types like `Page<>` & `Pageable`.
+
mappings can be defined globally or for a specific response or parameter or even only for a specific
endpoint. See xref:mapping/index.adoc[type mapping].

- Annotation based WebFlux support. Actually there is *no* explicit WebFlux support, but the mapping
allows defining a *single* wrapper classes that wrap non-array result types (e.g. `Mono<>`).
Together with the standard `array` mapping (e.g. `Flux<>`) there is WebFlux support. +

- generates human readable code.

- add additional parameters to an endpoint which are not defined in the OpenAPI description. For
example to pass a `HttpServletRequest` to the endpoint implementation. +

- supports bean validations. The constraints of the openapi description map to java bean
validation annotations. +

- allows excluding endpoints from generation. This is useful if the processor does not create the
correct code for an endpoint. That way the processor can still be used for all the other endpoints. +

- handle multiple responses by generating one endpoint method for each response content type. +
[.badge .badge-since]+since 1.0.0.M11+

- the generated code does not use swagger annotations. There is no need to generate the
documentation from the code when the code originates from the documentation (i.e. an openapi.yaml).
+
NOTE: The generated source code has to be included in a project to compile it. This is easily done
with the xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-gradle] plugin. See xref:gradle.adoc[Using Gradle].

- gradle support via xref:gradle::index.adoc[openapi-processor-gradle] plugin (the plugin is
currently the only option to run the processor).

== Feedback

In case some feature is missing, or the generated code is not 100% what you would expect create an
link:{oaps-issues}[issue]. Preferably with a test case. Providing a test case will help
significantly :-)

A test case is a single folder with an `openapi.yaml` & `mapping.yaml` file, and the expected Java
files the processor should create. The structure looks like this:

    my-new-test-case/
        openapi.yaml
        mapping.yaml
        generated/
           api/
               AnEndpointInterface.java
               .. more api interfaces ..
           model/
               AModelClass.java
               AnotherModelClass.java
               .. more model files ..

The `mapping.yaml` contains the type mapping information.

See the link:{oaps-inttests}[existing integration tests] for some examples.
